### 11.1 Direct-address tables

Store every key in array and access them by their index.

Insert, search, delete operation is O(1) since it acts as a normal array.

Ineffecient because direct-address table size has to be as big as the universe of keys but we only use a fraction of it -> space ineffecciency

#### Exercises

##### 11.1-1

Suppose that a dynamic set S is represented by a direct-address table T of length m.
Describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of S. What is the worst-case
performance of your procedure?

Have to iterate from the end until the first non-Null key is encountered. Worst-case time complexity: O(m) when there is no element in S

##### 11.1-2

A bit vector is simply an array of bits (0s and 1s). A bit vector of length m takes
much less space than an array of m pointers. Describe how to use a bit vector
to represent a dynamic set of distinct elements with no satellite data. Dictionary
operations should run in O.1/ time.

##### 11.1-3

Suggest how to implement a direct-address table in which the keys of stored elements
do not need to be distinct and the elements can have satellite data. All
three dictionary operations (INSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH) should run in O.1/
time. (Donâ€™t forget that DELETE takes as an argument a pointer to an object to be
deleted, not a key.)

Using double linkedlist to solve same key storage. INSERT and SEARCH would have the same time complexity. Since DELETE take a pointer as argument, that can be solved in O(1) time with double linked list. Example:
```cpp
node.previous = node.next;
delete node;
```

This can also be solved using ordinal linked list as:
```cpp
Node* tmp = node.next;
node.data = node.next.data;
node.next = node.next.next;
delete tmp;
```

##### 11.1-4

We wish to implement a dictionary by using direct addressing on a huge array. At
the start, the array entries may contain garbage, and initializing the entire array
is impractical because of its size. Describe a scheme for implementing a directaddress
dictionary on a huge array. Each stored object should use O.1/ space;
the operations SEARCH, INSERT, and DELETE should take O.1/ time each; and
initializing the data structure should take O.1/ time. (Hint: Use an additional array,
treated somewhat like a stack whose size is the number of keys actually stored in
the dictionary, to help determine whether a given entry in the huge array is valid or
not.)

### 11.2 Hash tables

Better than direct addressing because hash table reduces storage to K on average case where K is the number of needed keys but still maintains O(1) time complexity on average case. In wost-case, time complexity can be O(n) because of collision solving.

With direct addressing, an element with key `k` is stored at `k` slot. In hash table, the element is stored at slot `h(k)` where `h` is the hash function. Hash function maps the universe of keys into `m`, the sizeof array.

#### 11.2.1 Collision resolution by chaining

This appoach uses linkedlists to resolve collision. Instead of storing a pointer to an object in th array, it store a pointer to a linked list.

Operations:
* CHAINED-HASH-INSERT (`T`, `x`) O(1)
  * insert `x` at the head of list `T[h(x, key)]`
* CHAINED-HASH-SEARCH (`T`, `k`) O(n) - worst case
  * search for an element with key `k` in list `T[h(k)]`
*CHAINED-HASH-DELETE (`T`, `x`) O(1)
  * delete `x` from the list `T[h(x.key)]`

### 11.4 Open addressing

If there is collision, move the inserting element to the next non-NULL slot. For searching, it examines table slots from its hashed location until either it finds that element or ascertains that the element is not in the table.

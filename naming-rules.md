Pronounceable is better than abbreviated.
The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope.
Single-letter name is best if used locally.
Clarity is king of naming.
Say NO to Hugarian notation, member prefixes, and all kinds of encoding.
Say what you mean and mean what you say.
Consitency is the key.
One word for a thing, one thing for each word.
Say yes to GET and no to FETCH and RETRIEVE.
And please keep in mind.
Write to be read.

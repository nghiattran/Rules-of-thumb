## Chapter 1

### 1.1 Computer security concepts

* **Information Security**: is about how to prevent attacks, or failing that, to detect attacks on information-based systems
* **Computer Security**: generic name for the collection of tools designed to protect data and to thwart hackers
* **Network Security**: measures to protect data during their transmission
* **Internet Security**: measures to protect data during their transmission over a collection of interconnected networks

Three key objectives of computer security:

1. **Confidentiality**:
  * **Data confidentiality**: assures that private or confidential infomation is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
  * **Privacy**: Assures that individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected and stored.
2. **Integrity**:
  * **Data integrity**: Assures that information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner.
  * **System integrity**: Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner.
3. **Availability**: Assures that systems work promptly abd service us not denied to authorized users.

These are called **CIA triad**.

Definitions of a loss for each category:

* **Confidentiality**: Unauthorized disclosure of information.
* **Integrity**: Unauthorized modification or destruction of information.
* **Availability**: The disruption of access to or ues of information or information system.

#### Computer Security Challenges

1. not simple
2. must consider potential attacks
3. procedures used counter-intuitive
4. involve algorithms and secret info
5. must decide where to deploy mechanisms
6. battle of wits between attacker / admin
7. not perceived on benefit until fails
8. requires regular monitoring
9. too often an after-thought
10. regarded as impediment to using system

#### Computer Security vs. Network Security

**Computer Security**: deals with protecting a single machine.
**Network Security**: deals with protecting the communication and all participants in it.

### 1.2 The OSI security architerture

* **Threat**: a potential for violation of security; a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability.
* **Attack**: an assault on system security that derives from an intelligent threat.

**Security Architecture**:
* Security Attack: Any action that compromises the security of information.
* Security Mechanism: A mechanism that is designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack.
* Security Service: A service that enhances the security of data processing systems and information transfers. A security service makes use of one or more security mechanisms.
